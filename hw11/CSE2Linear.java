//CSE 002: Fundamentals of Programming
//CSE2 Linear program

//Program should:
//Prompt the user to enter 15 ints for studentsâ€™ final grades in CSE2.
    //Check that the user only enters ints, and print an error message if the user enters anything other than an int.
    //Print a different error message for an int that is out of the range from 0-100,
    //and finally a third error message if the int is not greater than or equal to the last int.
//Print the final input array.
//Prompt the user to enter a grade to be searched for.
    //Use linear search to find the entered grade.
    //Indicate if the grade was found or not, and print out the number of iterations used.
//Scramble the sorted array randomly,
// print out the scrambled array.
//Prompt the user again to enter an int to be searched for,
//and use linear search to find the grade.
//Indicate if the grade was found or not, and how many iterations it took.
