//Transpose Program

//In a new program called Transpose.java, implement matrix transposition on random matrices:  
//Begin by implementing a method called randomMatrix() that accepts two input variables:
    //These variables, width and height, are integer sizes for the matrix.
    //As output, randomMatrix() produces a two dimensional array of integers, in row-major representation,
        //whose elements are random integers between -10 and 10.
//Implement a second method called printMatrix() that prints two dimensional matrices represented in row-major format.
    //Introduce a test in this method that checks to make sure that the input matrix is rectangular.
    //Print out a warning that the matrix is not rectangular if it is indeed not rectangular.
//Next, implement a method called transposeMatrix() that:
    //takes a matrix represented by a two dimensional array in row-major format as input
    //returns a new two dimensional array in row major format that describes the transpose of that matrix.
//Finally, implement a main method that:
    //asks the user for width and height,
        //asking again (as many times as is necessary) if the user doesnâ€™t enter integers or positive values.
    //Once these values are provided,
        //generate the matrix,
        //print the matrix,
        //then generate the transpose,
        //and print the transpose.

    //imports the scanner class for inputs
